D. Additional Thoughts

  - Some design choices made during development:
      - Single column design used for mobile devices in portrait orientation
      - The carousel is prominent in mobile landscape orientation and user
        must scroll to see the various posts
      - React modules were used to handle the Carousel and the hamburger menu
      - The navigation bar position set to sticky

  - Application is structured into 2 principal folders:  public and source.
      - Public folder has the index html file and provides element to render
        application
      - Source folder contains the assets, components, data, and styles
      - Source folder also has the index and App js files that act as entry
        points to the application

  - It would have been helpful to have discussions with the team on how to best
    handle different screen sizes
